bio:
  life: |
    I am originally from Brazil, currently living in Bolivia.
    My father's family is from Japan. My mother's family is mixed,
    her grandfather is from Italy and her grandmother is from Portugal,
    this is from her mother's side. From her father's side, I don't know.
    I lived most of my life in Brazil, but also I lived in Chile and now
    in Bolivia. In Brazil I lived in Guarulhos and in Florian√≥polis.
  education: |
    I studied in public in the elementary school, then I join
    a private technical school in the informatics area.
    I studied at a Faculty for an Associated Degree, took a
    Postgraduate about IT, and much later I started a master degree
    in a Engineering Transportation.
  work: |
    I started to work at 14 as an Informatics Teacher assistant.
    I worked in a small company called "Quality Way" creating their
    software for managing their professionals, contracts, and
    business proposals. Then I moved to another company, a school and faculty,
    called Eniac, where I was part of a team to develop tools and platforms
    to support the and the information like students, payments, grades, etc.
    I worked at other places as well such as the city hall, a engineering lab,
    and companies such as The GRAPH Network, Quansight, Anaconda, Inlyse.
    Currently, I am the Executive Director of Open Science Labs, and I am founding
    other groups as DataTeller, Open Research Network, and LoveAI.
  family: |
    My parents are divorced, I have one sister 2 years younger than me,
    and another haf sister maybe 10 year younger than me. My mother is single now,
    my father has another wife.
  friends: |
    I have a lot of friends in Brazil and in other parts of the world.
    I am very friendly, and I love to gather friends to talk, eat something,
    have some drinks, etc. Unfortunately, I am very distant physically from
    most of my friends now.
  pets: |
    I have two dogs from Brazil, living with me in Bolivia. And another one from
    La Paz, Bolivia, who was adopted by my current partner/wife.
  health: |
    In general I don't have any critical issue with my health, but I need to
    take care of my health, specially I would need to sleep more, eat better,
    enjoy more life. I've been working and studying too much, so I don't have
    too much time for taking care of my health.
