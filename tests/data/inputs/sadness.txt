* I can't believe she left me. Everything feels so pointless now.
* I can't stop crying. It's like the pain just won't go away.
* Every place I go, every song I hear, it all reminds me of her.
* I'm so angry. How could she do this to me? I feel like breaking something.
* I don't know how to move on. She was everything to me.
* The nights are the worst. I just lie here, staring at the ceiling, feeling so empty.
* Why wasn't I enough for her? What did I do wrong?
* I don't see the point in anything anymore. I just want the pain to stop.
* I feel so alone. No one understands what I'm going through.
* Sometimes I just want to scream and let all this frustration out.
